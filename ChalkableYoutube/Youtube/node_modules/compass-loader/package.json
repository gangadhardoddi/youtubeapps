  "readme": "#This is 100% sourced code from sass-loader with slightly different dependencies. All credit to @jtangelder for sass-loader and @miniflycn for writing compass-node\n\nIf you do not need compass (various mixins and sprite generation, etc) then please see the sass-loader [https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader)\n\n# compass loader for [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)\n\n\n\n####Warning\nThis is all pretty beta stuff, I don't recommend using this in production just yet. \nHonestly you're better off using `sass-loader` and [https://github.com/Igosuki/compass-mixins](https://github.com/Igosuki/compass-mixins) then add `node_modules/compass-mixins/lib` as an include path.\n\n####You've been warned\n\n## Usage\n\n[Documentation: Using loaders](http://webpack.github.io/docs/using-loaders.html)\n\n``` javascript\nvar css = require(\"!raw!compass!./file.scss\");\n// => returns compiled css code from file.scss, resolves imports\nvar css = require(\"!css!compass!./file.scss\");\n// => returns compiled css code from file.scss, resolves imports and url(...)s\n```\n\nUse in tandem with the [`style-loader`](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader) to add the css rules to your document:\n\n``` javascript\nrequire(\"!style!css!compass!./file.scss\");\n```\n\n### webpack config\n\nIt's recommended to adjust your `webpack.config` so `style!css!compass!` is applied automatically on all files ending on `.scss`:\n\n``` javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    loaders: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.scss$/,\n        // Query parameters are passed to node-sass\n        loader: \"style!css!compass?outputStyle=expanded&\" +\n          \"includePaths[]=\" +\n            (path.resolve(__dirname, \"./bower_components\")) + \"&\" +\n          \"includePaths[]=\" +\n            (path.resolve(__dirname, \"./node_modules\"))\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n};\n```\n\nIf you utilize sprites or anything that utilizes your `config.rb` images path then you'll need to pass in both `imagePath` and `spriteDist` paths.\n``` javascript\nvar imagePath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../images'),\n    spriteOutput = imagePath;\nrequire(\"!style!raw!compass!./file.scss?imagePath=\" + imagePath + \"&spriteOutput=\" + spriteOutput);\n```\n\nComma separate imports are not supported.\n```\n@import \"language\", \"another/module\";\n```\nshould be written as\n```\n@import \"language\";\n@import \"another/module\";\n```\nSorry.\n\n\nAlso this depends on the latest node-sass 2.0 beta to return all included files so we can tell webpack about dependencies.\nThis may or may not work well, and also won't work when node-sass generates errors as it will not complete parsing the CSS and will not return all included files. To get this functionality sass-graph would have to be modified\n\n\n\nThen you only need to write: `require(\"./file.scss\")`. See [`node-sass`](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass) for the available options.\n\n## Install\n\n`npm install compass-loader`\n\n## Caveats\n\nCurrently the sass-loader does not follow all of the webpack loader guidelines. The general problem is that the entry scss-file is passed to [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) which does pretty much the rest. Thus `@import` statements inside your scss-files cannot be resolved by webpack's resolver. However, there is an [issue for that missing feature in libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/21).\n\n## License\n\nMIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n",
